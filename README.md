# TAKEOVER

by Martin Grider

2-6 players

## Setup

Everyone starts with X number of blinks with one face in their player color.
(Double-Click an isolated blink to change its starting color.)
You may play with additional empty blinks, or not.

## Gameplay

Take turns, and either add or move one of your blinks on the gameboard.
Your color will take over the adjacent faces of any attached blinks if
1. that face is empty, or
2. your blink has more faces in your color than the opposing blink has faces in the opposing color.

### Movement Notes
- Once it's been added to the board, a blink must be attached to all other blinks in play at the end of a player's turn.
- You may not move more than one blink on a turn. It doesn't matter which one you move as long as the rule above is followed.
- Watch out! Opposing colors will also take over other blink faces with the same rules as your color!

## Game Over
The game ends when one player has successfully taken over all faces of a single blink.

### Reset
Double-Click a group of blinks while playing or after game over to begin again.
